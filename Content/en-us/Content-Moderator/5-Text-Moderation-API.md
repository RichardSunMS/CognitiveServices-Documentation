# Text Moderation API #

Use the Content Moderator’s [**text moderation API**](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/57cf753a3f9b070c105bd2c1/operations/57cf753a3f9b070868a1f66e "Content Moderator Text Moderation API") to moderate text for profanity in more than 100 languages, report on malware and phishing URLs, and match against custom and shared lists that are specific to your business and users.

## Language detection ##

The first step to using the text moderation API is to have the algorithm detect the language of the content to be moderated. The API supports more than 100 languages. The **Detect Language** operation will return language codes for the predominant language comprising the submitted text in the following format:
{"DetectedLanguage": "eng"}

## Screening for profanity ##

The text moderation API’s **Screen** operation does it all – screen the incoming text (maximum 1024 characters) for profanity, detect the presence of malware and phishing URLs, and PII, while matching against custom lists of terms if needed.

The response will contain one or more of these, depending on what you ask it to do:

- Auto-corrected text
- Original text
- Language
- PII
- Location(s) of detected term(s)/phrase(s) within the submitted text
- Terms: detected profanity content
- Detected malware URLs

Let’s look at these in greater detail.

## Auto-correction ##

Let’s assume that the input text is: (the ‘lzay’ is intentional.)

	The <a href="www.bunnies.com">qu!ck</a> brown  <a href="b.suspiciousdomain.com">f0x</a> jumps over the lzay dog www.benign.net.

If you ask for auto-correction, the response will contain the corrected version of the text as in:

	“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

## Profanity terms ##

If any terms are detected, those are included in the response, along with their starting index (location) within the original text.

## Malware and phishing URLs ##

The Screen operation’s response will return any malware and phishing URLs detected and their categories as in adult, malware, and/or phishing, along with a probability score between 0 and 1.

## Creating and managing your custom lists of terms ##

While the default, global list of terms works great for most cases, you may want to screen against terms that are specific to your business needs. For example, you may want to filter out any competitive brand names from posts by users. Your threshold of permitted text content may be very different from the default list.

The Content Moderator provides a complete terms list API with operations for creating and deleting lists of terms, and for adding and removing text terms from those lists.

A typical sequence of operations would be to:

1. Create a list.
1. Add terms to your list.
1. Screen terms against the ones in the list.
1. Delete term or terms from the list.
1. Delete the list.
