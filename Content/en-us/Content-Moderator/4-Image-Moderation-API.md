# Image Moderation API #

Use Content Moderator’s [**image moderation API**](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/57cf753a3f9b070c105bd2c1/operations/57cf753a3f9b070868a1f66c "Content Moderator Image Moderation API") to moderate images for adult and racy content, and match against custom and shared lists even when file types are changed or images are otherwise altered. You can also implement optical character recognition (OCR) and face detection.

## Evaluating for adult and racy content ##

The Content Moderator API’s **Evaluate** operation returns a combination of a classification score (between 0 and 1) and Boolean data (true or false) to indicate whether the image contains adult or racy content. For example, when you call the API with your image (file or URL), you get back information that will include:

- The match score (between 0 and 1)
- A Boolean value (true or false) based on default thresholds and actual score

## Detecting text with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) ##

Optical Character Recognition (**OCR**) is a technology that detects text content in an image and extracts the identified text for search and numerous other purposes ranging from medical records to security and banking. If you do not specify a language, the detection defaults to English.

For example, a response with the detected language as English and the confidence scores for the identified text content will include:

- The original text
- The detected text elements with their confidence scores

## Detecting faces ##

Detecting faces is important in the context of content moderation because you may not want your users to upload any personally identifiable information (PII) and risk their privacy and your brand. Using the Detect faces operation, you can detect the probability of finding faces and their count in each image. 

A sample response from the **Find Faces** operation will include the following information:

- Faces count
- List of locations of faces detected

## Matching against your custom list ##

In many online communities, after users upload images or other type of content, the offensive may get shared multiple times over the following days, weeks and months. The costs of repeatedly scanning and filtering out the same image or even slightly modified versions of the image from multiple places can be expensive and error-prone.

Instead of moderating the same image multiple times, you may want to add the offensive images to your custom list of blocked content. That way, your content moderation system can compare incoming images against your custom list of images and stop any further processing right away.

The **Match** operation allows fuzzy matching of incoming images against any of your custom lists, created and managed using the List operations.

The operation will return the identifier and the moderation tags of the matched image, if found. The information returned includes:

- Match score (between 0 & 1)
- Matched image
- Image tags (assigned during a previous moderation)
- Image labels

## Creating and managing your custom lists ##

As mentioned previously, you would use custom image lists to make moderation of repeated content more efficient by simply matching against pre-approved or pre-rejected images, without having to go through the moderation-and-review workflow that can be both time consuming and error-prone if the images have already been tagged from a previous moderation step.

The Content Moderator provides a complete list management API with operations for creating and deleting lists, and for adding and removing images from those lists.

A typical sequence of operations would be to:

1. Create a list.
1. Add images to your list.
1. Match images against the ones in the list.
1. Delete image from the list.
1. Delete the list.
