#Microsoft Translator API
Microsoft Translator APIs can be seamlessly integrated into your applications, websites, tools, or other solutions to provide multi-language user experiences. Leveraging industry standards, it can be used on any hardware platform and with any operating system to perform language translation and other language-related operations such as speech to speech translation, text language detection or text to speech.

The Microsoft Translator Hub service and API lets you customize translations for words and sentences that are specific to a particular domain of knowledge.

The Microsoft Translator API also offers the unique ability to improve the accuracy of the delivered translations through the use of the Collaborative Translations Framework (CTF), allowing users to recommend alternative translations to those provided by Translatorâ€™s automatic translation engine.

To get started, you will first need to [sign up for a subscription] (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator/getstarted.aspx) to the text or speech API. Free tiers are available for 2 million characters per month for the text API and 2 hours per month for the speech API.
