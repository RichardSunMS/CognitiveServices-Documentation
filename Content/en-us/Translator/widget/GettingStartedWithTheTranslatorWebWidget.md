##Getting Started with the Translator Web Widget##

The Translator Web Widget is a simple way to make your web page immediately accessible to a worldwide audience through automatic translation. Translations are free of cost and not bound by any monthly volume restrictions. The Widget has a variety of features designed to make translations easy for visitors of your site:

* Drag and drop the floating Widget anywhere on the page. 
* When idle, the Widget will collapse to take less space on the page. 
* Share a translated page by clicking on the email icon. 
* Revert to original language by clicking on the exit button on the widget (X). 
* The Widget is localized according to your visitor’s browser accept-language setting. For example, if the visitor to your website is a Spanish speaker and your website is in English, they will see the Widget in Spanish. 
* Add support for a [Microsoft Translator Hub](https://hub.microsofttranslator.com/SignIn?returnURL=%2FHome%2FIndex) Category ID. 
* Switch to always-on https for use on intranets. 

The Translator Web Widget is available at [www.microsofttranslator.com/widget](http://www.microsofttranslator.com/widget). For instructions on adding the Widget to your page, click here. 

>Note: If you only want to add support for a few languages without adding the Widget to your page, and you do not need to support the CTF, the Hub or https (SSL), a simple alternative to the Widget is to add a link to your page to the translated version of your page through the Microsoft Translator “Bilingual Viewer”. 

>To add the translated version of the page, go to [www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx](http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx), enter your site URL, hit “translate”, and use the link displayed in your browser address window. 

>Example: The link for the Microsoft Translator home page in Spanish would be [www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=&to;=es&a;=microsoft.com/translator](http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=&to=es&a=microsoft.com/translator)
